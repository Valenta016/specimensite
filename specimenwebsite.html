	The creator of Kepler is Robert Slimbach, a font designer who was born in Evanston Illinois. Then moving to California at a young age, and eventually going to University of California Las Angeles. In college he then realized he had a passion for design and type, and with that realization he then got a job at a small printing company. Graduating from University he then went from a small printing job to a job at Autologic Inc. With designers we never feel fully accomplished and thats how Robert felt, with then instead going into freelancing. He learned alot and because of that, he used his passion and knowledge to develop ITC Slimback and ITC Giovanni, which are used by the Internation Typeface Corporation. You would think that would bring in a large sum of money, but over these years he was tight on cash, so he then got a job at Adobe. 1987 was a good year for Robert, he progressed drastically, creating many typefaces for digital media. Some of the typefaces he worked on were Utopia, Adobe Garamon, Minion and Poetica Font families. With all the font families he worked on he was then awarded in 1991, the Prix Charles Peignot from the Association Typographique Internationale and recieved other various awards for his inpact on typographic design. During the next 10 years he then develped various “Adobe Originals” typefaces, such as: Acumin, Arno, Brioso, Caflisch Script, Cronos, Garamond Premier, Adobe Jenson, Kepler, Sanvito, Adobe Text, Warnock, Myriad (which he designed in collaboration with designer Carol Twombly), Myriad Arabic, Myriad Hebrew, and Adobe Clean (Adobe’s current corporate typeface). Looking at that list of fontfamiles one of them should stick out, which should be KEPLER. Kepler is the typeface this website is designed around. Kepler is a sans serif and is designed to be in the tradition of classic modern 18th-century typefaces, and give off a more humanistic aesthitic combared to the traditional 18th-century type faces.

 <p> The ancient theory of color which carried through the Renaissance, was that all colors were mixtures of darkness and light—black and white. Aristotle, for instance, held that dark crimson comes from the mixture of black with sunlight or firelight. It was Isaac Newton who first fully developed a theory of color based on a color wheel. Newton had split white light into a spectrum by means of a prism and then wrapped the resulting spectrum around on itself to create the color wheel. This led the way to the now common notion of red, yellow, and blue as primary colors. </p>

<div class="bodycopy2">

What constitutes a primary color was, however disputed. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe held that yellow ad blue were primary. Newton and Goethe took very different approaches in their study of color. For Newton, color theory was something to be scientifically derived from experimentation in a lab. Goethe, on the other hand, took a more experiential and physiological approach. That the theory of primaries was so disputed came in part from the disconnect between theory and the reality of natural pigments which often formed muddied colors when mixed. The advent of synthetic colors which could closer approximate simple primaries, spurred a new interest among artists in the use of the color wheel for mixing a palette. At the same time, industrialization created a focus not just on color theory but on standardization of color and color naming.

<div class="bodycopy3">
<p>
Even though Newton's and Goethe’s color circles may seem to be at odds with each other, they are in some way both correct as they illustrate the behavior of color in different material. Newton describes how his spectral colors can mix most visible colors including white, and this is true because light mixes in an additive way: Combining lights of different colors will eventually result in white light. Goethe describes how his three primary colors can mix most visible colors including black, and this is true because pigments mix in a subtractive way: Combining paints of different colors will eventually result in black paint by subtracting waves of light.
